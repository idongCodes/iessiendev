            <div className='about-section-container'>
                <p className='mybio'>It has indeed been a wild ride for me. In my list of endeavours, landing my first position as a Software Engineer or Web Developer is at the top. How did I get here? They start asking you what you want to do with your life by the time you are a junior in high school - at least that is how I remember it.</p>
                <p className='mybio'>I never knew what I wanted or how to find that out. As far back as I can remember I have always been the type to go with the flow, never really knew how to or wanted to use the energy to plan things out. I remember my father suggesting Accounting - perhaps because my cousins, his brother's children all were going that route - so I enrolled in an Accounting associate degree programme at the local community college.</p>
                <p className='mybio'>My education at the community college was not going as well as planned. With the constant, 'find what you love', 'do what you love' quotes we're always hearing until this day, at the back of my head all the time - though I did not yet know what my own passion was - at that point I was definitely able to say it surely was not Accounting. I could not grasp the concepts, even with help from students that were helping me in and out of class. I should not forget to mention, quite frankly, accounting bored the hell out of me.</p>
                <p className='mybio'>If my memory serves me right, after two semesters of Accounting I switched programmes and pursued Computer Science. I remember the moment I was looking through the colleges course catalog, skimming through course offerings and their descriptions. The descriptions included lists of required topics, their levels and further shorter desriptions for each topic. I remember the feeling of my eyes and brain lighting up when I saw the Computer Science curriculum, from then on it was as if a small flame was lit and I had finally found my calling.</p>
                <p className='mybio'>However, it seems that small flame was not enough. I could not hack the curriculum, the Physics, and other courses I had to take felt like extra unnecessary bulk that had nothing to do with where I wanted to go - of course that could have just been an excuse. Long story short I did not keep fanning that flame, I ended up on academic probation. All of discouraged and lost, my attention went to the wrong things - hanging with the wrong people, rebelling against my folks, and many other things including thinking I was grown but not certainly not behaving like it.</p>
                <p className='mybio'>Fast forward, it got to a point it was too much, I remember sitting down on a porch outside with my friends at the time and spacing out. Found myself observing those around me and coming to the conclusion that something was not right in my life and this is not where I want to be anymore. I started secluding myself more and more, only leaving the house to go to work, and to church with the family on Sundays.</p>
                <p className='mybio'>I think I may have had an early midlife crisis? I started looking for a school to get into again, however none would accept me due to my performance. Until I found a techinical college in Rhode Island whose focus was in tech. They offered an associates programme that focused on Web Design, and so I enrolled. Fast forward two years, I graduated with my associates in science with a focus in Graphic, Multimedia and Web Design.</p>
                <p className='mybio'>But it was not enough, we barely touched any code besides HTML, CSS, and ActionScript. It was mostly 3D and print design. The portfolio I built during my time there was weak at best. As proud as I was, I realised it the hard way when applying for enrollment to universities after graduating. I had to look for where to go to obtain my Bachelor's degree because at the time there was no Bachelor's programme for what I had studied. There was one university I applied to that had a web design and development Bachelor's programme, I was able to get an admissions interview and my interviewer checked out my portfolio and said something along the lines of, 'This work looks like a high schooler did it'. He was trying to be nice, but I got it.</p>
                <p className='mybio'>After applying to many universities there was one that finally accepted me. Anxious to finish where I left off I attended the first university that accepted me. I enrolled in their Bachelor's of Science in Interactive Media as it focused in web development conepts. I also enrolled in Computer Science because there were programming courses involved, like, Java and C. I was doing pretty well until responsibilty hit, I had to move off campus, get a job and start paying rent. It got to a point I was no longer able to continue paying tuition so my account was put on hold and I could no longer register for any classes.</p>
                <p className='mybio'>Discouraged and hopeless I was in limbo for four years, until December 2019. Lambda and their ISA have been a God send. Since the programme started in January 2020 I continue to gain immersive remote experience, writing algorithms, solving problems with code, working on projects individually and in teams, and building a network full of people from all walks of life in different tech fields that go hand in hand with software and web development. Not only that, but I am doing something that I am finally passionate about, even when it frustrates me. Watch out for me, because after all, I am going to become Codekage one day!</p>

                         My beginnings as an Engineer/Developer started humble. This photo captures quite a story. The MacBook Pro you see in the photo I bought it in 2015. I was able to buy it solely because of those refund cheques that universities give to their students when financial aid over pays tuition. The monitor you see there belongs to my baby bro. He has been an Engineer/Developer for  seven to ten years. When my Lamda Education became official, he helped me out and gave me one of his monitors. The five year old, 16GB, slow as molasses, iPad Air with the cracked screen belonged to my girlfriend, I have been using it as basically a third screen that I either played music and have all my zoom meetings on.

                        I suppose I should say 'Dogga' because she is a female dog? My dog daughter Bella, she is a pain but I love her to bits - whatever that phrase actually means. She likes chewing on big logs of wood and orange cones, totally ignores toys when I buy them for her until she impulsively decides to shred them to pieces. I brought her home at the right time, right around when the pandemic started, which was also when I started my coding journey in January - it has been nice being lucky to work from home and be with her.

                        I would love to say one of my hobbies is photography but I can't. I have not used the camera for much since we bought it. One dream at a time? This photo was taken in Florida, spent a week in Kissimmee, for what would be my second vacation in my twenty plus years of living. Definitely plan to be traveling it up soon after I land my first SWE position! I dream to become an awesome Full-Stack Software Engineer, the next Codekage, like Hokage in Naruto, but for programming.
